# 🎨 OpenGL Cyan Square and Triangle Assignment

## 📌 Objective

Create an OpenGL program that displays a **cyan-colored square on a white background**.  
On top of this square, a **cyan triangle** is drawn such that the triangle shares **two corner points of the square**.  

The OpenGL window should open with the **title set as your full name which is "Srabon" in this case**, and the program should close when the **first letter of your name which is "s"** is pressed.

✅ This repository contains:
- Fully working modern OpenGL C++ code using shaders
- Proper comments and formatting
- Screenshot showing output and terminal (proof of execution)
